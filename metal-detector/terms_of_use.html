    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>These Terms of Use ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you and us regarding your use of the <strong>Magnetic Metal Detector Pro</strong> mobile application (the "App"). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Scope of the App</h2>
    <p>The App displays magnetic field readings captured from your device's built-in magnetometer. <strong>The App visualizes magnetic field variations using the device's magnetometer.
While magnetic field changes may sometimes correlate with nearby ferromagnetic objects, the App is not a professional metal detection instrument and should not be relied on for safety-critical or high-accuracy purposes.</strong> Results are provided for reference or entertainment only.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Subscriptions and In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>The App may offer auto‑renewable subscriptions or other in‑app purchases ("IAPs"). Details of any subscription (title, length, and price) are provided in the App and in the corresponding App Store in‑app purchase listing:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Title:</strong> (Displayed in the App and App Store)</li>
      <li><strong>Length:</strong> (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly)</li>
      <li><strong>Price:</strong> The price you are charged is determined by the App Store at the time of purchase.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Subscriptions are auto‑renewable. To manage or cancel subscriptions, use the App Store subscription management tools in your account settings. The Developer does not control cancelation or billing; those are handled by Apple.</p>
    <p><strong>Restore Purchases:</strong> A "Restore Purchases" function is available inside the App (Settings → Upgrade to Premium -> Restore Purchases). Tapping that button will initiate restore of previously purchased non‑consumable purchases or subscriptions using the standard StoreKit APIs.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Refunds and Pricing</h2>
    <p>All payments are processed by Apple and are subject to Apple's terms and conditions. Refunds, if any, must be requested through Apple. Contact information for Apple support is available in the App Store. Prices shown in the App are for reference only; final pricing at checkout is provided by the App Store.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Privacy Policy</h2>

    <h2>6. Restrictions and Prohibited Uses</h2>

  <section>
    <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event shall the Developer be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (a) your access to or use of the App; (b) any unauthorized access to or use of our servers and/or any personal information stored therein; or (c) any interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the App.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>9. Changes to Terms and App</h2>
    <p>We may modify these Terms from time to time. If changes are material, we will provide notice within the App or via other means. Continued use of the App after changes indicates acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
